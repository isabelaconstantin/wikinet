Hence, the first eigenvectors each gives rise to a as-smooth-as-possible signal, where points that are close have close signal value and points that are far away have larger difference of values. It returns a good clustering. There are other methods to cluster a graph, for example one could use k-mean on nearest neigbors without using eigenvectors.
