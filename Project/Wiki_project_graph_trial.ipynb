There was a new audience for comics now, and it wasn\\'t just the little kids that traditionally had read the books. The Marvel of the 1960s was in its own way the counterpart of the [[French New Wave]]... Marvel was pioneering new methods of comics storytelling and characterization, addressing more serious themes, and in the process keeping and attracting readers in their teens and beyond. Moreover, among this new generation of readers were people who wanted to write or draw comics themselves, within the new style that Marvel had pioneered, and push the creative envelope still further.&lt;ref>{{cite web |last=Sanderson |first=Peter |publisher=Comics in Context (column) No. 14, [[IGN]]| date=October 10, 2003 |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/595/595576p1.html |title=Continuity/Discontinuity |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721101749/http://comics.ign.com/articles/595/595576p1.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref>}}\\\\n\\\\nLee\\'s revolution extended beyond the characters and storylines to the way in which comic books engaged the readership and built a sense of community between fans and creators.&lt;ref>{{cite web |url=http://costa.lunarpages.com/bp/bpindex.html |title=Marvel Bullpen Bulletins |publisher=(reprinted on fan site) |access-date=April 27, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502154017/http://costa.lunarpages.com/bp/bpindex.html |archivedate=May 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref> He introduced the practice of regularly including a credit panel on the splash page of each story, naming not just the writer and penciller but also the inker and letterer. Regular news about Marvel staff members and upcoming storylines was presented on the [[Bullpen Bulletins]] page, which (like the letter columns that appeared in each title) was written in a friendly, chatty style. Lee  remarked that his goal was for fans to think of the comics creators as friends, and considered it a mark of his success on this front that, at a time when letters to other comics publishers were typically addressed \\\\\"Dear Editor\\\\\", letters to Marvel addressed the creators by first name (e.g. \\\\\"Dear Stan and Jack\\\\\").&lt;ref name=\\\\\"DAK64\\\\\" /> By 1967, the brand was well-enough ensconced in popular culture that a March 3 [[WBAI]] radio program with Lee and Kirby as guests was titled \\\\\"Will Success Spoil Spiderman\\\\\" [sic].&lt;ref name =nyt03031967>{{cite news |title=Radio |date=March 3, 1967 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B1EF93E5F107B93C1A91788D85F438685F9 |access-date=April 20, 2013}} Abstract only; full article requires payment or subscription&lt;/ref>\\\\n\\\\nThroughout the 1960s, Lee scripted, art-directed and edited most of Marvel\\'s series, moderated the letters pages, wrote a monthly column called \\\\\"[[Stan\\'s Soapbox]]\\\\\", and wrote endless promotional copy, often signing off with his trademark motto, \\\\\"[[wikt:excelsior|Excelsior]]!\\\\\" (which is also the [[List of U.S. state and territory mottos|New York state motto]]). To maintain his workload and meet deadlines, he used a system that was used previously by various comic-book studios, but due to Lee\\'s success with it, became known as the \\\\\"[[Marvel Method]]\\\\\". Typically, Lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a brief synopsis rather than a full script. Based on the synopsis, the artist would fill the allotted number of pages by determining and drawing the panel-to-panel storytelling. After the artist turned in penciled pages, Lee would write the [[word balloon]]s and captions, and then oversee the lettering and coloring. In effect, the artists were co-plotters, whose collaborative first drafts Lee built upon.

They were turning out most of the artwork. Then there was the publisher, Martin Goodman... And that was about the only staff that I was involved with. After a while, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby left. I was about 17 years old [sic], and Martin Goodman said to me, &#39;Do you think you can hold down the job of editor until I can find a real person?&#39; When you&#39;re 17, what do you know?

There was a new audience for comics now, and it wasn&#39;t just the little kids that traditionally had read the books. The Marvel of the 1960s was in its own way the counterpart of the [[French New Wave]].... Marvel was pioneering new methods of comics storytelling and characterization, addressing more serious themes, and in the process keeping and attracting readers in their teens and beyond. Moreover, among this new generation of readers were people who wanted to write or draw comics themselves, within the new style that Marvel had pioneered, and push the creative envelope still further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sanderson |first=Peter |publisher=Comics in Context (column) No. 14, [[IGN]]| date=October 10, 2003 |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/595/595576p1.html |title=Continuity/Discontinuity |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721101749/http://comics.ign.com/articles/595/595576p1.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}\\\\n\\\\nLee&#39;s revolution extended beyond the characters and storylines to the way in which comic books engaged the readership and built a sense of community between fans and creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://costa.lunarpages.com/bp/bpindex.html |title=Marvel Bullpen Bulletins |publisher=(reprinted on fan site) |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502154017/http://costa.lunarpages.com/bp/bpindex.html |archivedate=May 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the practice of regularly including a credit panel on the splash page of each story, naming not just the writer and penciller but also the inker and letterer. Regular news about Marvel staff members and upcoming storylines was presented on the [[Bullpen Bulletins]] page, which (like the letter columns that appeared in each title) was written in a friendly, chatty style. Lee has said that his goal was for fans to think of the comics creators as friends, and considered it a mark of his success on this front that, at a time when letters to other comics publishers were typically addressed \\\\&quot;Dear Editor\\\\&quot;, letters to Marvel addressed the creators by first name (e.g. \\\\&quot;Dear Stan and Jack\\\\&quot;).&lt;ref name=\\\\&quot;DAK64\\\\&quot;/&gt; By 1967, the brand was well-enough ensconced in popular culture that a March 3 [[WBAI]] radio program with Lee and Kirby as guests was titled \\\\&quot;Will Success Spoil Spiderman\\\\&quot; [sic].&lt;ref name =nyt03031967&gt;{{cite news |title=Radio |date=March 3, 1967 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B1EF93E5F107B93C1A91788D85F438685F9 |accessdate=April 20, 2013}} Abstract only; full article requires payment or subscription&lt;/ref&gt;\\\\n\\\\nThroughout the 1960s, Lee scripted, art-directed and edited most of Marvel&#39;s series, moderated the letters pages, wrote a monthly column called \\\\&quot;[[Stan&#39;s Soapbox]]\\\\&quot;, and wrote endless promotional copy, often signing off with his trademark motto, \\\\&quot;[[wikt:excelsior|Excelsior]]!\\\\&quot; (which is also the [[List of U.S. state and territory mottos|New York state motto]]). To maintain his workload and meet deadlines, he used a system that was used previously by various comic-book studios, but due to Lee&#39;s success with it, became known as the \\\\&quot;[[Marvel Method]]\\\\&quot;. Typically, Lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a brief synopsis rather than a full script. Based on the synopsis, the artist would fill the allotted number of pages by determining and drawing the panel-to-panel storytelling. After the artist turned in penciled pages, Lee would write the [[word balloon]]s and captions, and then oversee the lettering and coloring.
