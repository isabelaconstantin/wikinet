# A Wikipedia Tour of Death or how University College Boat Club became popular overnight

---

#### What is the goal of this project?
Using wikipedia data, this project aims to uncover how the death of a famous person impacts the number of views of neighboring wikipedia pages. We are doing three case studies, analysing the deaths of [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking), [Stan Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee), [Alan Rickman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Rickman).

#### What do you find in here ?
* `source` contains all the code for this project. In it, you can find 3 notebooks and some helper functions in `helpers`:
    * `1_DataAcquisition` notebook contains the pipeline for crawling wikipedia to obtain the subsampled graphs and the number of views for each wikipedia article at certain points in time. The functions we used for building the graphs are in `helpers/wiki_graph_sample.py` and for getting user activity of a certaing page over time in `helpers/page_visits.py`
    * `2_DataExploration` notebook contains the pipeline for studying the network properties of the sampled graphs (i.e. diameter, clustering coefficient, degree distribution etc)
    * `3_DataExploitation` notebook has the pipeline for analysing and visualising the number of page views for the nodes of the graph (i.e. our signal)

* You can read a detailed description of our project [here](https://github.com/isabelaconstantin/wikinet/blob/master/Project/Report/Report_NTDS.pdf)
* In `data` folder you can find the graphs we analysed (`*.gpickle`) and the corresponding signal on the nodes (`*_signal.pickle`)
